# Garrys-Modular-Combat
A gamemode for Garry's Mod that is based on the HL:DM mod, Modular Combat. As the game has been abandoned, I thought I would create my own version and add new content.
I've made it highly customizable, making it where you can add whatever content from the workshop that you want, including Weapons and NPCs.

Adding your own modules might be a little bit harder, but if you have an idea feel free to make a pull request. I'd be very grateful if you included code for your
module but if I think its cool I might just add it myself. I want this project to be huge, so I'd love to check out any idea y'all have for cool modules.
